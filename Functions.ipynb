        "In Python, both functions and methods are callable objects, but they differ in terms of how they are defined and how they are used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Function:\n",
        "A function is a block of code that is defined using the def keyword. It can be called independently of any object.\n",
        "It does not belong to any particular object or class.\n",
        "A function can accept parameters, execute logic, and return values.\n",
        "Example:\n",

        "Method:\n",
        "A method is a function that is associated with an object (usually an instance of a class) and is defined within a class.\n",
        "It is called on an object and implicitly takes the object (usually referred to as self) as its first parameter.\n",
        "Methods are used to operate on the data that belongs to the object or class.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",

        "In Python, function arguments and parameters are key concepts that allow us to pass information to functions so they can perform specific tasks. Let's break down each term and how they work:\n",
        "\n",
        "Parameters:\n",
        "Parameters are the variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed into the function when it is called.\n",
        "They define what type of inputs the function expects.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def greet(name, age):  # 'name' and 'age' are parameters\n",
        "    return f\"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Arguments:\n",
        "Arguments are the actual values that are passed to the function when it is called. These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters in the function.\n",
        "Arguments can be provided in different ways, and there are several types of arguments in Python (e.g., positional arguments, keyword arguments, etc.).\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "# Here, \"Alice\" and 25 are arguments\n",
        "print(greet(\"Alice\", 25))\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3.What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "Basic Function: Defined with def, called by name.\n",
        "Default Arguments: Parameters with default values.\n",
        "Variable-Length Arguments (*args): Accepts multiple positional arguments.\n",
        "Keyword Arguments (**kwargs): Accepts multiple keyword arguments.\n",
        "Lambda Function: A small, anonymous function defined with lambda.\n",
        "Passing Functions: Functions can be passed as arguments.\n",
        "Returning Functions: Functions can return other functions (closures).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4.What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "The return statement in a Python function is used to exit the function and send a value (or multiple values) back to the caller. When a function executes a return statement, the function stops running immediately, and the specified value is returned to wherever the function was called.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5.What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "In Python, iterators and iterables are related concepts but serve different purposes in the context of loops and iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterable:\n",
        "An iterable is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time. These are objects you can iterate over using a loop, such as a for loop. To be considered an iterable, an object must implement the __iter__() method or the __getitem__() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common examples of iterables include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists\n",

        "Dictionaries\n",
        "Sets\n",
        "Files\n",
        "In essence, an iterable is any object that can provide an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterator:\n",
        "An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data, which you can traverse or iterate over. An iterator knows how to obtain the next value in the sequence and can produce values one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be considered an iterator, an object must implement two methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "__iter__(): This returns the iterator object itself. This method is called when an iterable is passed to iter().\n",
        "__next__(): This method returns the next value in the sequence. When there are no more items to return, it raises the StopIteration exception to signal the end of the iteration.\n",
        "When you call iter() on an iterable, it returns an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6.Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "In Python, a generator is a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values lazily, meaning the values are produced on-the-fly as they are needed, rather than being stored in memory all at once. This makes generators very memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets or streams of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Generators Work:\n",
        "Generators are defined using functions or expressions that yield a sequence of values one at a time. Unlike regular functions that return a value and terminate, a generator function uses the yield keyword to return a value. Each time the generator's __next__() method is called, it resumes execution from where it last yielded a value, continuing until it reaches another yield or completes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A generator produces items lazily (on-demand) rather than returning all values at once. This results in better memory efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics of Generators:\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Values are produced only when required, and they are not all stored in memory.\n",
        "State Retention: Generators \"remember\" the point of execution after each yield, allowing them to continue from where they left off.\n",
        "Efficient: Because they donâ€™t hold all the values in memory at once, they are more memory-efficient than lists or other collections.\n",
        "Iterators: Generators are iterators themselves, meaning they can be used in loops like for loops or passed to next().\n",
        "\n",
        "A generator can be defined in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a Generator Function: A generator function is defined just like a regular function, except it uses yield to return values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of a Generator Function:\n",
        "def count_up_to(max):\n",
        "    count = 1\n",
        "    while count <= max:\n",
        "        yield count  # Yield the current count and pause execution\n",
        "        count += 1\n",
        "When you call count_up_to(), it doesn't return a list. Instead, it returns a generator object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a Generator Expression: A generator expression is similar to a list comprehension, but it returns a generator object instead of a list. It's more compact and allows you to create generators in a single line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of a Generator Expression:\n",
        "squares = (x * x for x in range(5))\n",
        "for square in squares:\n",
        "    print(square)\n",
        "# Output:\n",
        "# 0\n",
        "# 1\n",
        "# 4\n",
        "# 9\n",
        "# 16\n",
        "In this case, the generator expression (x * x for x in range(5)) creates a generator that produces the squares of numbers from 0 to 4, one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7.What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: No need to store all values in memory; they are produced on-the-fly.\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Values are generated only when needed, saving computation time.\n",
        "Reduced Overhead: Generators do not require creating large intermediate data structures.\n",
        "State Retention: Generators \"remember\" their state, enabling efficient iteration over large or infinite datasets.\n",
        "Performance: Generators can offer faster performance when dealing with large datasets, especially in cases where not all values are needed at once.\n",
        "Simpler Code: Generators often result in more concise, readable, and maintainable code.\n",
        "Support for Infinite Sequences: Generators can handle infinite sequences without consuming unbounded memory.\n",
        "When to Use Generators:\n",
        "When dealing with large datasets where you want to minimize memory usage.\n",
        "When processing streaming data or sequences that may not fit entirely in memory.\n",
        "When you need infinite sequences or long-running processes where not all data is needed at once.\n",
        "When you want to simplify your code for lazy evaluations, like when processing data one item at a time.\n",
        "Generators are a powerful feature in Python, offering more efficient memory and processing capabilities compared to regular functions, particularly in situations where the data is large, infinite, or needs to be processed lazily.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8.What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function that is defined using the lambda keyword. Lambda functions are typically used for short-lived operations where defining a full function using the def keyword would be overkill.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax of a Lambda Function:\n",
        "\n",
        "lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "lambda: The keyword to define a lambda function.\n",
        "arguments: The inputs to the lambda function (can be zero or more).\n",
        "expression: The expression that is evaluated and returned when the lambda function is called.\n",
        "Key Characteristics of Lambda Functions:\n",
        "Anonymous: Lambda functions do not have a name. They are also called anonymous functions.\n",
        "Single Expression: They can only contain a single expression. You cannot have statements or multiple expressions inside a lambda.\n",
        "Return Value: The result of the expression is automatically returned by the lambda function (no need for a return statement).\n",
        "Example of a Lambda Function:\n",
        "# A simple lambda function to add two numbers\n",
        "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
        "\n",
        "print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
        "Here, lambda x, y: x + y defines a function that takes two arguments x and y, and returns their sum. The function is then assigned to the variable add.\n",
        "When to Use Lambda Functions:\n",
        "Short, simple operations: Use lambda when the function is small and does not need a name.\n",
        "One-time use: Ideal when the function will only be used once in the program, such as in map(), filter(), sorted(), etc.\n",
        "In conjunction with functional programming constructs: Lambda functions work well in functional programming paradigms where you pass functions as arguments (e.g., map(), filter(), reduce()).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9.Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "The map() function in Python is used to apply a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) and returns a map object, which is an iterator that yields the results of applying the function to each item of the iterable. The map() function is commonly used when you want to transform or process all the elements in an iterable based on some logic, without needing to write an explicit loop.\n",

        "function: The function that will be applied to each item in the iterable. This can be a normal function, a lambda function, or any callable.\n",
        "iterable: The iterable whose elements you want to process with the function. This could be a list, tuple, string, or any other iterable. You can pass multiple iterables as well.\n",
        "How map() Works:\n",
        "Apply the function: map() applies the provided function to each element of the iterable (or iterables if multiple are passed).\n",
        "Return a map object: It returns a map object, which is an iterator that generates the results. The map object can be converted to a list, tuple, or other data structures if needed.\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: The function is applied lazily, meaning the results are produced one at a time as you iterate over the map object. This is memory efficient, as it doesn't generate all the results upfront.\n",
        "Example 1: Using map() with a Normal Function:\n",
        "Hereâ€™s an example where a normal function is applied to each element in the iterable.\n",

        "In Python, the map(), reduce(), and filter() functions are all used to process iterables in different ways, and each serves a unique purpose. While they are often used in a similar manner (i.e., they all take a function and an iterable as input), the behavior and results they produce differ.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. map() Function:\n",
        "Purpose: The map() function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (or multiple iterables) and returns an iterator that produces the results.\n",

        "2. reduce() Function:\n",
        "Purpose: The reduce() function is part of the functools module and reduces an iterable to a single value by applying a binary function (a function that takes two arguments) cumulatively to the items in the iterable.\n",
        "Use Case: It's used when you want to accumulate or combine the items in an iterable into a single result. The operation is performed sequentially from left to right.\n",
